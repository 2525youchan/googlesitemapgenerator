--- Build under Linux ---
Users can build a binary from source by themselves. There are two steps.
0) Prerequisite:
  a) gcc-4.0+ (including g++) is the supported building tool.
  b) GNU Make 3.81 is required. Others are not verified.

1) Generate Makefile with configure script.
  configure script is a standard configuration script generated by autoconf.

  a) Options:
  Besides common configuration options like CC, CPPFLAGS, and etc, some other
  options are provided.
  --with-apache-bin=APACHE_BINARY_PATH
    This option tells the script the target apache instance. The script can
	retrieve apache version information and architecture information from it.
  --with-apache-version=1.3|1.3.e|2.0|2.2
    This option specifies version of target apache instance. Specially, 1.3.e
	is used for apache 1.3.x with EAPI defined.
  --with-apache-arch=32|64
    This option specifies target cpu architecture of apache instance. 32 is
	used for i386 Linux, while 64 is used for x86_64 Linux.

  b) Sample:
  ./configure --with-apache-bin=/usr/sbin/httpd CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.1
    This will generate a Makefile, which is used to build binary for
	/usr/sbin/httpd. The building tool is /usr/bin/gcc-4.1.
  ./configure --with-apache-version=1.3.e --with-apache-arch=32
    This will generate a Makefile, which is used to build binary for
	apache version 1.3 with EAPI defined.

2) Run Makefile to build the binary.
  a) Targets:
    all:
	  Build binary files and leave them in source directories.
	  This is the default make target.
	clean:
	  Clean binary files from source directories.
	distclean:
	  "clean", and remove files generated by configure script.
	installer:
	  "all", and copy binary files to ./sitemap-install directory.
	install:
	  "installer", and start to install automatically.

--- Build Under Windows ---
0) Prerequisite:
  a) Microsoft Windows SDK 6.0
  b) Microsfot Visual Studio 2005

1) Steps to build MSI package.
  a) Open sitemap.sln with Miscrosoft Visual Studio 2005.
  b) Change "Configuration" to "Release", and "Platform" to "x64".
     Build IIS6_Filter and IIS7_Module project under this setting.
  c) Change "Configuration" to "Release", and "Platform" to "Win32".
     Build IIS6_Filter, IIS7_Module, and SitemapService under this setting.
  d) Build "SitemapSetup" project.
     Find installation package in ./Release/sitemap_setup.msi
